# Project: E.M.B.E.R.
**E**fficient **M**anagement **B**eyond **E**xcellent **R**esults

EMBER is a free open-source GTD ( **G**et **T**hings **D**one ) software.
It's portable, secure, efficient and easy to use while offering a beautifully
crafted interface.

But how is it different from other great todo-lists manager?

* First, it's free and open source.
* Secondly, it's cross-platform and portable so you can use it on MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc. It's written in Java.
* Thirdly, it's a desktop software, not a terminal or web-based app. This is my main target. Android and IOS support later.

And finally, I will try to add some unique functionalities like a personal assistant, custom animations, a focus on student tasks, etc.


## Participate!
EMBER is still in **early stage** development. If you want to help, feel free to contact me.
My personal goal is to try making the *de facto* free, open-source and portable To-Do List software.
